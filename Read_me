    Idea is there will be a player and a bot.
    Both will play a snake game usually.
    Rules:: 1) player should not eat bot's food and bot will not eat player's food.
                if player eats bot's food , it's body will loose 2 balls.
            2) player should not touch bot's body nor even bot should touch player's body.
                if touched then who touches others body will be out.
            3) player wins if one of them gets double size the other.
